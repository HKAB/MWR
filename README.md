<!--[Moving Window Regression: A Novel Approach to Ordinal Regression]()-->
A novel ordinal regression algorithm, called moving window regression (MWR), is proposed in this paper. First, we propose the notion of relative rank (ρ-rank), which is a new order representation scheme for input and reference instances. Second, we develop global and local relative regressors (ρ-regressors) to predict ρ-ranks within entire and specific rank ranges, respectively. Third, we refine an initial rank estimate iteratively by selecting two reference instances to form a search window and then estimating the ρ-rank within the window.
